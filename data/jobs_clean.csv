candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in largescale machine learning or deep learning and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains The position based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT Stanford and CMU Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 20 project Multimodal Deep Learning Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing speech recognition text mining etc In each area the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources including video speech text etc is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance Unsupervised Deep Learning Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most timeconsuming steps in the deep learning pipeline and is often not feasible The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data Deep Learning on Embedded Devices Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller with little loss in performance This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current stateoftheart deep learning models Online Deep Learning Towards Near Real Time NRT model updates Stateoftheart deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure A common problem is when new data including new classes are constantly added to an evolving alwayslearning system Algorithms to move towards realtime updates will be essential Extreme Deep Learning Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance However there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding Towards better modelling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation However there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic

WhiteBox Deep Learning Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely blackboxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little
